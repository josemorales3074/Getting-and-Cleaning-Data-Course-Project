## Files

* **CodeBook.md** - This file is the code book that describes variables, data, and transformations executed to get clean data.

* **run_analysis.R** - This file performs the data preparation and the five steps required in the project:
(1) Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set; 
(2) Extract only the measurements on the mean and stddev for each measurement; 
(3) Use descriptive activity names to assign name to the activities in the data set;
(4) Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names;
(5) From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

* **FinalData.txt** - This file is the exported final data after these five steps.
